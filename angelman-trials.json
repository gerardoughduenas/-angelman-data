The disorder is caused by a deficiency of a maternally transmitted gene and is inherited at birth. Children with AS, however, are often not diagnosed until they are between 3 and 7 years old. Symptoms of AS may include, but are not limited to, functionally severe developmental delay; speech impairments; movement or balance problems; and behavioral uniqueness, including any combination of frequent laughter or smiling, apparent happy demeanor, easily excitable personality, hand flapping movements, and short attention span. There are four molecular variations of AS, but past clinical studies have been inconsistent in highlighting the phenotypic differences between them. This study will gain a better understanding of the disease progression and clinical features of AS by observing children with AS over a period of 5 to 10 years. The study will also attempt to establish genotype-phenotype correlations, which might aid in future clinical care of AS patients.\n\nParticipation in this observational study will be limited to current or future patients at one of the five study sites. A clinical evaluation will be performed at baseline, including a general patient history, physical and neurological examinations, a nutritional assessment, neuro-imaging, electroencephalography, laboratory testing, and neurodevelopmental testing. A blood sample or mucosal sample will also be taken at baseline to acquire DNA for potential genetic testing. All assessments except the neuro-imaging, electroencephalography, and blood sampling will be repeated at yearly study visits for as long as funding can be secured.

The lack of known molecular targets associated with AS has hampered the development of specific therapeutics. However, a recent surge of potential therapeutics for other disorders associated with cognitive disruption has begun to be used in human clinical trials. The molecular modes of action for many of these new therapeutic agents have correlates to counter the molecular defects observed in AS. One such agent is minocycline (MC), a drug traditionally used as an antibiotic. This compound administered to a mouse model of AS showed a significant decrease in motor deficit and an increase in long term potentiation. The investigators believe a similar result will be observed when minocycline is administered to the AS patient and may lead to the development of an effective AS therapeutic.","detailedDescription":"This prospective single arm cohort study is to be conducted at the University of South Florida. The study will examine the effect minocycline (MC) has on the traits of Angelman Syndrome.\n\nMinocycline HCl is an FDA approved antimicrobial medication in the tetracycline family of drugs. Of all the tetracyclines, MC is the most lipid soluble and most active. Unlike other antibiotics in this family, MC possesses the unique characteristic of being able to cross the blood brain barrier. The study dosage has been used in other trial treatments of other neurologic disorders with positive outcomes. Studies of long-term administration of MC at the study dose have been shown to be safe and well tolerated. This dosage has already been approved by the FDA for use in the treatment of bacterial infections of multiple organ systems, and acne vulgaris.\n\nIt is important to note that minocycline is not approved to treat Angelman syndrome or to be used in children younger than 8 years old. The study protocol has been reviewed by several physicians and scientists and been deemed safe to proceed. As with any medication the potential for side effects exist. The side effects range from serious to mild and include allergic reactions to upset stomach. In order to minimize this risk, the medical staff will perform a thorough medical history and physical examination before the prescription is issued to ensure no allergy to this medication, penicillin or another tetracycline exists. Discoloration of the teeth is potential adverse effect that exists when taking high doses of MC over long periods of time. The tooth discoloration is permanent and the parent or guardian of the participants will be made aware of this potential side effect prior to enrollment in the study. In other studies using MC, the most common complaint was gastrointestinal upset.\n\nRecruitment \\& Prescreening - We anticipate some of the study participants will live far from the study site. In order to reduce screen failures (travel to the site only to find out your child doesn't meet the study criteria) the following process is required. To give parents the opportunity to consider the study and have time to consult with their doctor(s), we will begin recruitment approximately one week after the study has been published on this website. Parents will be asked to submit their information electronically by clicking the link at the bottom of this webpage or by accessing weeberlab.com/clinical_trials.html. In the event they do not have internet access, they may call the study coordinator for assistance. Once you have indicated your interest in participation, a packet of information will be sent to you via email (or postal service if you prefer). The packet will include an informed consent document, a release of medical information and a form for your primary care doctor to complete and return directly to us. All of this information will be reviewed by the medical staff to determine your child's eligibility. Out of the first 50 eligible participants, 24 will be randomly selected by the Clinical and Investigational Science Institute (CTSI) at USF.\n\nStudy Procedure - Those selected will be required to travel to the study site a total of 3 times for 2 days each at their own expense (some assistance may be available through the Foundation for Angelman Syndrome Therapeutics, visit www.cureangelman.org). It is important that you seriously consider your ability to complete the study. The number of participants we are allowed to enroll is strictly governed and funding is limited. It is imperative data is collected from each of the 24 participants to ensure the best possible results. We do not know if your child will benefit from receiving this medication, which is why we are doing this study.\n\nDuring the visits your child will be asked to provide a blood sample and undergo an electroencephalogram gram (EEG), physical examination as well as behavioral assessments. During the first visit, the study drug, minocycline, will be dispensed to you. You will be asked to administer the study drug to your child twice daily. You will also be asked to log the administration to confirm compliance with the study regimen. A telephone interview will be conducted with you after 4 weeks of treatment to assess drug tolerance and to record any changes you may have observed. The study medication will be discontinued after 8 weeks of treatment. At the same time point, you will have to return to the study site for a follow up visit identical to the primary visit. The final follow up visit will occur at the 16 week time point (8 weeks following the minocycline treatment). This visit will be identical to the first two visits and will assess the lasting effects of the medication. Below is a summary of the study procedures.\n\nSummary of Study Procedures:\n\n1. Recruitment Begins - Interested parents contact the study staff via the internet form.\n2. Prescreening packets are sent - Informed Consent Document, Health Information Release \\& Primary Care Physician (PCP) questionnaire\n3. Eligibility Determined for 30 potential participants\n4. Random Selection of 24 participants\n5. Baseline Testing - Informed Consent Obtained, Lab work and EEG performed History and Physical exam performed\n6. Enrollment - Study Neurologist confirms the participant meets the study criteria.\n7. Behavioral Assessment\n8. Minocycline Administration\n9. Telephone Interview (4 weeks)\n10. Discontinue Minocycline (8 weeks)\n11. Follow up Assessment (8 weeks)\n12. Telephone Interview (12 weeks)\n13. Final Follow up assessment (16 weeks)\n\nAt the bottom of the page you will find a link to the weeberlab.com/clinical_trials.html website.

These individuals will serve as control subjects.\n\nThe study will use questionnaires designed to identify sleep disorders and how they affect behavior and quality of life.\n\nThe principal goals of this study are:\n\n1. To see how common sleep disorders are in individuals with Angelman Syndrome, Rett Syndrome or Prader-Willi Syndrome;\n2. To see how sleep disorders affect behavior in these individuals;\n3. To see whether sleep disorders and related behavior problems improve or worsen with age;\n4. To see how specific disease conditions relate to sleep disorders and how bad the sleep disorders are;\n5. To develop new treatment options to improve quality of life and behavior issues; and\n6. To evaluate current treatment options to improve sleep problems in these individuals.","detailedDescription":"Subjects with AS, RTT or PWS and normal siblings (controls) will be recruited for study participation.\n\nSubjects will be recruited from the Rare Disease Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) consortium registries for AS, RTT and PWS. The RDCRN registries provide listings of individuals currently enrolled in the RDCRN along with clinical and genetic diagnosis, medical history and contact information.\n\nThe RDCRN consortium sites for AS, RTT and PWS will participate in the study. These sites will recruit study participants, obtain informed consent and administer the sleep questionnaires. Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval will be obtained at each RDCRN consortium site.\n\n\"Subjects\" is defined as those children with a diagnosis of AS, PWS, and RTT. Subjects will be divided into separate study arms based upon their medical diagnosis. Study arms will consist of: 1) AS group, 2) PWS group, 3) RTT group, and 4) control group. \"Control group\" is defined as normal healthy siblings of subjects.\n\nStudy participants and parents/guardians will be asked to complete the study questionnaires during the clinic visit. The questionnaires are brief and should not be difficult to complete. It is anticipated that the questionnaires can be completed in 15-30 minutes. If parents are unable to complete the questionnaires at the time of their scheduled clinic visit they will be asked to take the questionnaires home to complete and to mail them back to the research team. When the research team receives the returned questionnaires they will be reviewed for completion. If questions are skipped or left blank, a member of the research team will call the family to complete the missed questions over the phone.\n\nParents/guardians are allowed to answer the questions on behalf of the study participants and will be asked to answer all the questions for each age-appropriate questionnaire in order for the responses to be scored correctly. Subjects with AS, RTT and PWS and normal siblings will complete the same questionnaire forms.\n\nStudy participants will be administered the questionnaires again in 12-24 months at a follow-up RDCRN clinic visit or by mail to assess the natural history of their sleep behavior and any sleep disorders.\n\nStudy participants identified as having a potential severe sleep disorder based on questionnaire responses will be contacted or sent a letter by the study investigators and advised to see a sleep specialist for further evaluation.\n\nPotential \"Subjects\" must be members of the RDCRN consortium registries with available contact and clinical diagnostic information on file. These individuals will be invited to participate in the study at their next regularly scheduled RDCRN visit.\n\nStudy recruitment will continue for one year. Subjects with a clinical diagnosis of AS, RTT or PWS, or normal siblings of these individuals will be recruited for study participation.\n\nThe sample size of study participants, including controls, will be based upon the number of individuals currently enrolled in the RDCRN consortium registries. Currently the combined number of individuals in the AS, RTT and PWS RDCRN consortium registries is 1082. The breakdown by disorder is: 678 RTT, 172 AS, 141 PWS. Final sample size will be the total number of subjects consented during the one year recruitment period. A projected enrollment total would be approximately 1,000 total individuals ( 500 subjects including 300 RTT, 100 AS, 100 PWS \\& 500 controls)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Rett Syndrome","Prader-Willi Syndrome","Angelman Syndrome","Sleep Problems"],"keywords":["Rett Syndrome","Prader-Willi Syndrome","Angelman Syndrome","Sleep Problems"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":804,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Rett Syndrome","description":"Children and adolescents, age between 0-19 years, with clinical diagnosis of Rett Syndrome; currently enrolled in the Rare Disease Clinical Research Network registry."},{"label":"Angelman's Syndrome","description":"Children and adolescents, age between 0-19 years, with clinical diagnosis of Angelman's Syndrome; currently enrolled in the Rare Disease Clinical Research Network registry."},{"label":"Prader-Willi Syndrome","description":"Children and adolescents, age between 0-19 years, with clinical diagnosis of Prader-Willi Syndrome; currently enrolled in the Rare Disease Clinical Research Network registry."},{"label":"Control","description":"Siblings of RTT, AS and PW subjects will serve as control subjects."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in sleep behavior as measured by the child's sleep habits questionnaire (CSHQ) for Rett Syndrome, Angleman and control group","timeFrame":"Change from Baseline sleep behaviors at 24 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ) - Sleep Disordered Breathing Subscale","timeFrame":"Change from Baseline sleep behaviors at 24 months"},{"measure":"Child's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) (ages 0-19)","timeFrame":"Change from Baseline sleep behaviors at 24 months"},{"measure":"Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale (PDSS) (ages 6-19)","timeFrame":"Change from Baseline sleep behaviors at 24 months"},{"measure":"Cleveland Adolescent Sleepiness Questionnaire (CASQ) (ages 6-19)","timeFrame":"Change from Baseline sleep behaviors at 24 months"},{"measure":"Narcolepsy Questionnaire (ages 0-19)","timeFrame":"Change from Baseline sleep behaviors at 24 months"},{"measure":"Unique Questionnaire (ages 0-19)","timeFrame":"Change from Baseline sleep behaviors at 24 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nEligible Inclusion Criteria - Subjects\n\n1.

It is usually given with carbidopa, a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor, to increase the bioavailability of levodopa. Animal studies have suggested that levodopa can reverse the excess phosphorylation of some enzymes involved in synaptic and neuronal function, including calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase type 2 (CaMKII).\n\nRecently, it was shown that excess phosphorylation of CaMKII may be responsible for some of the neurological deficits seen in Angelman syndrome. Therefore, it is hypothesized that levodopa may lead to an improvement in the neurodevelopment and abnormal movements (e.g. tremors) in children with Angelman syndrome.\n\nAlthough many children have used levodopa for a variety of medical conditions over the last 30 years, it has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in children, and it has not been formally studied in children with Angelman syndrome, so we do not know what dose of levodopa is most appropriate for children with Angelman syndrome.\n\nTherefore, the purpose of this study is to find out the highest dose of levodopa that children with Angelman syndrome can tolerate without any serious side effects.\n\nOnce we know the dose of levodopa that can be tolerated by children with Angelman syndrome, we will conduct a larger follow-up study to find out whether levodopa will lead to an improvement in their development and tremor."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Angelman Syndrome"],"keywords":["Angelman syndrome","Levodopa","Carbidopa","L-dopa"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":16,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Levodopa/Carbidopa","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Other Names:\n\nSinemet L-dopa\n\nDosages are based on levodopa.\n\nEach cohort of 3 subjects will be placed on an increasing dose of levodopa (2, 5, 10, and 15 mg/kg/day) for 1 week, provided subjects in the preceding cohort tolerated the lower dose.\n\nLevodopa/Carbidopa is a combined formulation that will be dispensed as capsules.

AS is caused by a missing or incomplete chromosome 15 that is inherited from the mother. Diagnosis of AS is usually made between three and seven years of age, when the characteristic behaviors and features of the disease become most evident. Prior to AS diagnosis, the symptoms may be mistaken for cerebral palsy or autism. Physical, occupational, and speech therapy, communication skills development, and behavior modification help to improve the quality of life of these children, but other treatments are needed.\n\nIn a previous study, decreased DNA methylation, which is a type of chemical change in DNA, was observed in an individual with AS; this condition may be a primary cause of AS. It is hypothesized that promoting increased DNA methylation might reduce the severity of AS symptoms. Betaine, creatine, Metafolin, and vitamin B12 are compounds normally found in the body that are involved in the DNA methylation pathway. Increasing the concentrations of these compounds in the body may enhance DNA methylation. This study will evaluate the efficacy of four dietary supplements in treating the symptoms of AS.\n\nThis study will last 12 months. Study visits will occur at study entry and Month 12. A selected group of participants, those who meet the diagnostic criteria for autism, will also be evaluated at Month 6. At study visits, participants will undergo an electroencephalogram (EEG). Medical history, physical exam, neurological exams, and developmental assessments will also be performed. Urine and blood collection, including tests to determine the blood levels of the dietary supplements, will occur at study entry and Months 6 and 12. Participants will receive two daily doses of Metafolin, betaine, and creatine, and one daily dose of vitamin B12 for the duration of the study. Parents will be asked to complete a questionnaire at each visit to report their child's behavior while taking the dietary supplements. Parents will also be contacted by phone periodically to assess changes and/or progress in their children."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Angelman Syndrome","Nervous System Diseases"],"keywords":["Developmental Delay","Mental Retardation","Ataxia","Microcephaly","Seizures"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":90,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive two daily doses of Metafolin, betaine, and creatine, and one daily dose of vitamin B12 for 12 months.","interventionNames":["Drug: Betaine","Drug: Creatine","Drug: Metafolin","Drug: Vitamin B12"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Betaine","description":"100-200 mg per kg per day by mouth with a maximum of 6 grams divided in two daily doses","armGroupLabels":["1"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Creatine","description":"200 mg per kg per day with a daily maximum of 5 grams divided in two daily doses","armGroupLabels":["1"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Metafolin","description":"0.5 mg per kg per day by mouth with a maximum of 8 milligrams divided in two daily doses","armGroupLabels":["1"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Vitamin B12","description":"1 mg by mouth per day for all weights and ages","armGroupLabels":["1"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Average Change in Functioning in Specific Areas of Development, Including Speech and Communications Skills, Cognitive Abilities and Daily Living Skills","description":"Primary:\n\nBayley Scales of Infant Development measures Mental Developmental Index standard scores 0 (least skilled) - 100 (most skilled) Psychomotor Developmental Index standard scores 0 (least skilled - 10 (most skilled) Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS), Communication standard scores 0 (least skilled) - 100 (most skilled) Daily Living Skills standard scores 0 (least skilled) - 100 (most skilled) Socialization standard scores 0 (least skilled) - 100 (most skilled) Motor Skills standard scores 0 (least skilled) - 100 (most skilled) Preschool Language Scale (PLS), Auditory Comprehension 0 (least skilled) - 100 (most skilled) Expressive Communication 0 (least skilled) - 100 (most skilled)","timeFrame":"Baseline, 1 year"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Levels of Betaine, Creatine, Dimethylglycine, Guanidinoacetate, Homocysteine, and Methionine.","timeFrame":"Baseline, 1 year"},{"measure":"Change in RBC Folate","timeFrame":"Baseline, 1 year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Diagnosis of AS\n* In stable condition with relatively good control of seizures\n* Willing to comply with treatment, study visit schedule, and study assessments\n* Willing to take oral or G-tube medication\n* Willing to be contacted monthly during the course of the study\n* Parent or guardian willing to provide informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* History of liver or kidney disease\n* Currently being treated for a serious acute illness\n* Known hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs\n* Received high-dose folate drug treatment in the 12 months prior to study entry\n* Other significant medical problems, including those involving the liver, kidney, or heart\n* Other comorbidities, genetic disorders, or extreme prematurity; children with autism are not excluded","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"1 Day","maximumAge":"5 Years","stdAges":["CHILD"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Arthur L.

Approximately 70%--75% of individuals affected with PWS and AS have an interstitial deletion of 15q11-q13. Regarding the remaining individuals with PWS, maternal uniparental disomy is the cause in 20% of cases, imprinting errors in 3% of cases, and chromosomal translocation in approximately 1% of cases. Regarding the remaining cases of AS, paternal uniparental disomy accounts for 2% of cases and mutations in the UBE3A gene for 20% of cases.The PWS/AS critical region was examined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), methylation-specific PCR (M-PCR), and methylation-specific multiplex-ligation dependent probe amplification(MS-MLPA).

Sinemet is a medication that helps to raise dopamine levels (a chemical that signals nerve cells) in the brain and central nervous system. There is evidence that dopamine concentrations may be abnormal in patients with Angelman syndrome. This study is investigating whether Sinemet helps motor control, intellectual function and the achievement of developmental milestones in people with Angelman syndrome","detailedDescription":"Angelman syndrome (AS) is a well-recognized cause of disability in children who present with movement or balance disorder, usually ataxia and/or tremulous movement of the limbs, severe speech and cognitive delay behavior disorders and was initially described by Harry Angelman as the \" happy puppet syndrome\" due to their disposition. Seizures, abnormal sleep-wake cycles and distinctive facial features have been also commonly seen. This disorder is almost exclusively diagnosed in childhood but adults have been reported. Angelman syndrome affects an estimated 1 in 12,000 to 20,000 people. Many of the characteristic features are caused by the loss of function of maternally inherited UBE3A allele on chromosome 15q11-q13 locus. Several different genetic mechanisms can cause loss of function of maternally inherited UBE3A gene. Majority of AS is caused by deletion of chromosome 15q11.2-q13 (approximately 70%), 11% is caused by a mutation in maternal copy of UBE3A. Paternal uniparental disomy (pat UPD) occurs in 7%. Rarely, a defect in imprinting region and chromosome rearrangement can also lead to AS.\n\nUbiquitin-protein ligase E3A (UBE3A) is involved in protein degradation through the ubiquitin proteasome pathway and displays predominantly in human fetal brain and adult frontal cortex. UBE3a is essential in the regulation of GTP cyclohydrolase I, an essential enzyme in dopamine biosynthesis. Knockout mouse studies have evaluated dopamine dependent behaviors as well as dopamine synthesis, content and release in the mesolimbic and nigrostriatal pathway of AS model mice. Impairment of UBE3A results in the accumulation of protein substrate and is also associated with a loss of dopaminergic neuronal function which plays a role in the clinical symptomatology. AS ( knockout) mice were reported to have maternal deficiency of Ube3a with reduced dopamine cell number in the substantia nigra pars compacta ((basal ganglia) . They demonstrated motoric and cognitive deficits. There are several mouse models that have demonstrated both the disorder and the beneficial effect of L dopa in the knockout mouse providing a basis for clinical human trials.\n\nTo date the primary treatment of children with Angelman syndrome has been only supportive and symptomatic such as physical, occupation and speech therapies, melatonin and Benadryl for insomnia and the treatment of seizure disorders. Little attention or success has been directed to the primary gait disturbance, namely ataxia and the cognitive impairment including processing, attention and speech delays which are cardinal features of the disorder.\n\nIn 2001, Harbord has reported two adults with Angelman syndrome and Parkinson's disease who had a positive response to L Dopa constituting the first report of the use of levodopa in Angelman syndrome.\n\nPediatric neurotransmitter disorders have previously been recognized involving the dopamine pathway. In the past investigators have reported on the distinct developmental and behavioral profile, cognitive deficits, motor and language skills utilizing standardized testing in the NIH Rare Disease Clinical Research Network, Angelman Rett collaborative.\n\nThis study will look at the effects of L Dopa on motor control including ataxia, cognitive function and developmental milestones in subjects with Angelman syndrome."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Angelman Syndrome"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"This is an open label study to assess the motor and cognitive and developmental effects of carbidopa/levodopa when administered orally in doses of 1 -10mg per kg per day.

Indeed, this has helped to identify functionally altered areas in patients with temporal epilepsy by simply using the resting EEG signal. Furthermore, it has been seen that the propagation of neuronal avalanches (VNs) correlates with the morphological organization of the cerebral cortex. Therefore, NAs represent a measure with direct utility for studying functional reorganization pre and post drug/surgical treatment. In addition, the aperiodic portion of the signal may represent a noninvasive measure of the excitation/inhibition relationship, which is known of being altered both in epilepsy and in some rare neurodevelopmental syndromes (example: Angelman and Dup15q)","detailedDescription":"Electroencephalography is the tool of choice for the diagnosis of epilepsy. Its use is increasing in the clinic, especially in its high-density form (HD-EEG), because it can be used as a neuroimaging tool, supporting the process of identifying the epileptogenic network (NE) and monitoring the evolution of brain connectivity over time in relation to the epileptic process.In particular, the reorganization of the functional connectome following pharmacological and/or surgical treatment of epilepsy is an aspect that is still little studied, but it could represent a useful prognostic factor that can improve the clinical management of the affected person. In addition, high-density EEG can be applied for the purpose of characterizing functional brain connectivity in some rare neurodevelopmental diseases, particularly Angelman syndrome and Dup15q syndrome, pathological increasingly being studied as a model of neurodevelopmental, cognitive and behavioral alterations in addition to epilepsy. Relatively to recent developments of potentially \"disease modifying\" therapies for these pathologies, there is indeed a need for markers of brain functioning useful to objectively monitor clinical development.\n\nThe present study involves the systematization of data from noninvasive clinical-instrumental assessments such as EEG and structural MRI, acquired during the diagnosis process in drug-resistant epilepsies and rare neurodevelopmental syndromes associated with epilepsy, in order to analyze the relationship between functional-structural organization of the brain system and clinical aspects, including cognitive and behavioral functioning. In the context of epilepsy, a data collection will be carried out to which recent analytical approaches related to the study of the functional connectome will be applied, with the aim of characterizing the reorganization of brain networks over time, hypothesizing a process of progressive \"normalization\" of these in subjects who present, after the course of treatment (pharmacological and/or surgical), total freedom or a significant reduction of seizures. In parallel, the relationship between the organization of functional networks and cognitive/behavioral functioning pre- and post-treatment will be analyzed, in order to obtain a dynamic and longitudinal view of the patients' clinical evolution. With this in mind, it is important to understand that functional activity is intrinsically linked to brain structures, and in fact the project takes into account the anatomo-functional relationship of the connectome. This relationship is crucial in rare neurodevelopmental syndromes, such as Angelman syndrome and Dup15q, where the use of the structural-functional connectome is a relevant novel element for the purpose of characterizing a highly complex picture that disrupts the global development of the affected child/person. Indeed, the relationship between changes in functional relationships between brain areas and underlying physical connections, as well as the relationship between these and neurodevelopment, are still poorly understood. The second goal of the project is therefore to generalize the use of these patient-friendly methods, starting with data collected with noninvasive instrumentation, in order to improve the characterization of the neurocognitive profile, as well as a useful tool to identify syndrome-specific biomarkers to be used in monitoring clinical development."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Epilepsy","Angelman Syndrome","Dup15q Syndrome"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Epilepsy","description":"EEG resting state recording, neuropsychological evaluation","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: High Density EEG recording","Diagnostic Test: Rey Complex Figure Test"]},{"label":"Angelman Syndrome","description":"EEG resting state recording, neuropsychological evaluation","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: High Density EEG recording","Diagnostic Test: Rey Complex Figure Test"]},{"label":"Dup15q Syndrome","description":"EEG resting state recording, neuropsychological evaluation","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: High Density EEG recording"]},{"label":"Control Group","description":"EEG resting staterecording","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: High Density EEG recording"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"High Density EEG recording","description":"Recording of resting state high density EEG (128 channels)","armGroupLabels":["Angelman Syndrome","Control Group","Dup15q Syndrome","Epilepsy"]},{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Rey Complex Figure Test","description":"Memeory functioning evaluation","armGroupLabels":["Angelman Syndrome","Epilepsy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Differences in the network coherence values in theta and alpha band after treatment","description":"The outcome 1 one will be finalized to measures the changes of the coherence values before and after the treatment.

The efficacy and safety of Circadin 2/5 mg will continue to be assessed during an open-label extension period of 13 weeks.","detailedDescription":"This is a randomized placebo-controlled study in children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and neurodevelopmental disabilities caused by neurogenetic diseases.\n\nChildren who are found to be eligible for the study will follow a 4-week, basic sleep hygiene and behavioral intervention wash-out period, and will continue in a 2-week single-blind (SB) placebo run-in period. Then, they will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Circadin® 2 mg or placebo for 3 weeks in a double-blind treatment period.\n\nAfter 3 weeks of treatment, on the last day of Week 5 ±3 days (Visit 3), sleep variables will be assessed to determine if dose modification (an increase to 5 mg) is required. Children will then continue on 2 or 5 mg of Circadin® or placebo for an additional double-blind period of 10 weeks. This double-blind period will be followed by an open-label period of 13 weeks. At the end of the 13-week open-label period on the last day of Week 28 ±3 days (Visit 5), sleep variables will be assessed to determine if a potential additional dose modification (i.e., an increase either to 5 mg for patients who are still on 2 mg or an increase to 10 mg for patients who are on 5 mg) is necessary (If a dose increase is decided upon, the dose increase should be from 2 mg to 5 mg, or 5 mg to 10 mg). Children will continue at 2, 5, or 10 mg Circadin® in an open-label period for another 78 weeks of follow-up, which will include continuous safety monitoring and 2 efficacy assessment time points at Weeks 41 and 54. The study will end with a 2-week SB placebo run-out period.\n\nEach patient will participate in the study until the end of the second open-label safety follow-up period, and 2 week run-out period. The study duration will be 112 weeks, including the 4-week wash-out period with sleep hygiene and behavioral intervention."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Sleep Disorders"],"keywords":["Sleep disturbance","Circadian","Prolong release melatonin","Autism Spectrum Disorder","Smith-Magenis Syndrome","Angelman Syndrome","tuberous sclerosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":125,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Circadin 2/5/10 mg","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Active arm","interventionNames":["Drug: Circadin 2/5/10 mg"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Placebo arm","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Circadin 2/5/10 mg","description":"Circadin 2/5/10 mg.

These devices have beneficial effects on improving children's motor skills and increasing their social interaction and participation. In addition, during the use of assistive devices, there are some limitations related to size, weight, usability, mobility, and adaptability to children. Considering these limitations, the Dynamic Scaffolding System (DSS) device was developed. The DSS device aims to position children with moderate to severe mobility impairment vertically (standing and sitting) and to step with support. The aim of the current study was to compare the duration of use of the Dynamic Scaffolding System (DSS) device in children with different levels of motor impairment, to report adverse events during use, and to examine parental satisfaction. One hundred children with special needs (60% cerebral palsy, 40% other diagnoses: genetic, metabolic, neuromuscular diseases) aged between 9 and 108 months (mean 44.94±17.59) and their parents (94% mother, 6% father) who had used the DSS device for at least 6 months were included in the study. Data were collected from the participants via telephone interview. Demographic data such as age, gender, diagnosis, and level of motor impairment were recorded.

Recently, various imprinting diseases were reported in animals (Large Offspring syndrome (LOS)) and humans (Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS)) born after ART. In all cases, an imprinting defect was involved (loss of methylation at ICR2 in BWS, at SNRPN in AS and at IGF2R DMR2 in LOS). These data suggest that ART procedures may impair the establishment or the maintenance (following fertilization) of methylation marks at maternally imprinted loci. In view of these data, the aim of this study is to determine if children born following ART exhibit an increased risk of imprinting defects. If the answer is yes, the second objective is to identify the problematic step in the ART procedure and thus to suppress or modify this step.","detailedDescription":"Methodology: assessment of the methylation status at 9 different imprinted loci (using Southern blot and methyl-specific quantitative PCR) in 3 groups of patients: 150 children naturally conceived, 150 children conceived after ovarian stimulation but with in vivo fertilization, and 150 children conceived after ovarian stimulation and in VITRO fertilization. These analyses will be performed on cord blood. Fragments of placental tissue will also be collected for further analyses. Patients will be selected in maternity hospitals associated with ART departments ( ANTOINE BECLERE HOSPITAL, Cochin HOSPITAL, Saint-Vincent de Paul HOSPITAL, Jean VERDIER HOSPITAL, Tenon HOSPITAL and Dijon Hospital).\n\nThis work is also a unique opportunity to establish a DNA, RNA and tissue collection allowing further investigation regarding other epigenetic modifications than DNA methylation, not only at imprinted loci, but also in other genomic regions regulated by epigenetic modifications."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Natural Pregnancy","Pregnancy, Ovarian"],"keywords":["Genomic imprinting","Reproductive techniques, assisted","Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome","Angelman syndrome"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"whole blood (serum, ADN) and placenta samples"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":542,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1","description":"Pregnancy after ICSI or IVF"},{"label":"2","description":"Pregnancy after ovarian stimulation"},{"label":"3","description":"natural pregnancy"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Assessment of the methylation status at 9 imprinted loci in cord blood collected just after birth.","timeFrame":"At the birth"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Assessment of other epigenetic marks (histone modifications) at imprinted loci and at non imprinted but epigenetically regulated loci.","timeFrame":"At the birth"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nMother :\n\n* Age: 26 to 40 at conception\n* Single foetus pregnancy\n* Signed informed consent\n* Affiliation to French health benefits\n* Absence of maternal pathology\n* Normal foetal karyotype (if available)\n* Known procedure of ovarian stimulation\n* ART procedure without sperm or oocyte donation\n* ART in a participating ART departments\n* Delivery in a participating hospital\n\nFather\n\n* Age : 18 to 50 at conception\n* Signed informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Abnormal foetal karyotype (if available)\n* Delivery before 35 weeks of amenorrhea\n* Delivery in not participating hospital\n* Delivery complication leading to the absence of sample collection","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"FEMALE","minimumAge":"26 Years","maximumAge":"40 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Women followed in a participating ART departments","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Yves Le BOUC, PUPH","affiliation":"Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Trousseau Hospital","city":"Paris","zip":"75012","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":48.85341,"lon":2.3488}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"18279777","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Gicquel C, El-Osta A, Le Bouc Y.

To assist with the development of the test, we will need to collect blood samples from women whose child was diagnosed with a genetic or MD/D syndrome, a blood sample from that child as well as a blood sample from their confirmed unaffected siblings. Since the test is based on Natera's Parental Support™ technology, buccal or blood samples from the biological fathers will also be requested.\n\nA recent abstract from a five year study on prenatal microarray testing revealed that 1.6% of women who present for routine prenatal indications have a positive microarray test. With the frequency of microdeletions and microduplications (MD/D) now known to be higher than previously thought, the field is likely to move toward offering invasive testing for microarray abnormalities to all pregnant women. Although non-invasive prenatal testing for aneuploidy is now clinically available, it has become clear that non-invasive prenatal testing for MD/D is equally important. However, access to these samples is made difficult as the standard of care for offering microarray analysis to all pregnant women will take time to come to fruition. We would like to develop this non-invasive as the standard of care so that less women will have to undergo invasive testing for the diagnosis of microarray abnormalities.

Parental imprinting is an epigenetic regulation phenomenon leading to the monoallelic expression of some genes. Its establishment takes place in the gametes and its maintenance is important at the early embryonic stage. Increase in the prevalence of conception by assisted reproductive technology (ART) has already been found in patients with imprinted disorder such as Angelman, Beckwith-Wiedemann or Prader Willi Syndromes, and more recently with SRS; ART is associated with an increase in the frequency of SRS. Several hypotheses are formulated to explain this increase. The first one is the involvement of the infertility etiology in the imprinting disorder genesis. The second one is the involvement of ART technics in the genesis of abnormal gamete imprinting during their manipulation or during imprinting maintenance at early embryonic stages.\n\nOur main objective is to estimate ART conceptions prevalence in children followed for a SRS. The secondary objectives are to estimate infertility prevalence among parents of patients with SRS, to estimate factors frequency possibly responsible for the genesis of imprinting anomalies among parents of patients with SRS, to describe the infertility causes and to detail ART technics used (stimulation protocols, type of fertilization used, modality of embryonic culture and transfer, embryonic characteristics).\n\nA transversal pilote study will be firstly conducted in parents of patients followed in Silver Russell Syndrome Reference Center (Pediatric Endocrine department, in Trousseau Hospital, Paris).\n\nData collection will be done by phone, after collecting the non-opposition of the parents, in order to complete a questionnaire concerning their fertility and conception mode of their child. If ART was used to conceive, a questionnaire concerning the details of the ART technics used will be sent to the doctor and:or the ART biologist, who performed the ART. The data will be anonymized and collected on a REDCap database.","detailedDescription":"There is no planned follow-up, and the parents' participation is limited to the telephone interview.\n\nThe aim is to conduct / carry out a single-centre observational cross-sectional study, on the one hand by collecting data from the centre's patient files (molecular anomaly leading to the diagnosis of Silver Russell syndrome) and on the other hand by conducting a 30-minute telephone questionnaire to collect additional data. The first part of this questionnaire will be carried out with the parents of these patients in order to specify their age, height, weight, drug consumption and profession at the time of the start of pregnancy, as well as the time required for conception and recourse to ART.\n\nIn the event of recourse to ART, with the authorisation of the parent(s), a questionnaire will be sent to the clinical doctor and/or the biologist at the ART centre."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Syndrome, Russell Silver"],"keywords":["Imprinting disorders","- Silver Russell syndrome","Infertility","Assisted Reproductive Technology","In vitro fertilization"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":125,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of SRS patients whose mode of conception was ART","description":"To estimate ART conceptions prevalence in children followed for a SRS","timeFrame":"Day 0, visit inclusion"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Estimate infertility prevalence among parents of patients with SRS (defined as a delay to conception of more than 12 months)","description":"The time required for conception is defined by the time between stopping contraception and the start of pregnancy","timeFrame":"Day 0, visit inclusion"},{"measure":"Estimate frequency of maternal and paternal BMI at the time of conception","timeFrame":"Day 0, visit inclusion"},{"measure":"Estimate frequency of consumption of tobacco and alcohol at the time of conception","description":"At the time of conception maternal and paternal BMI, consumption of tobacco and alcohol and both parents' occupations","timeFrame":"Day 0, visit inclusion"},{"measure":"Estimate frequency of parents's profession at the time of conception","timeFrame":"Day 0, visit inclusion"},{"measure":"The etiology of infertility in detail","description":"Study infertility causes in detail this will be do through a questionnaire send to the fertility doctor who treated the parents.","timeFrame":"3 years, end of the study"},{"measure":"Describe the ART techniques used from the point of view of ovarian stimulation but also oocyte, sperm and embryo manipulations","description":"Details of ART techniques used this will be do through a questionnaire send to the fertility doctor who treated the parents.","timeFrame":"3 years, end of the study"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* ≥ 18 years old\n* parents from patients followed in the department \" Unité Fonctionnelle Endocrinienne du Pr Netchine \" for un Silver Russell syndrome\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* parent's objection\n* patient under State Medical Aid","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Parents of children being followed for Silver-Russell syndrome at the Silver-Russell Syndrome Reference Centre at Trousseau Hospital in the Endocrine Functional Investigation Unit.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Irène Netchine, PUPH, MD, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"0033 1 44 73 66 31","email":"irene.netchine@aphp.fr"},{"name":"Marie-Pierre Luton, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+33(0) 1 87 89 26 00","email":"mariepierre.luton@aphp.fr"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Irène Netchine, PUPH, MD, PhD","affiliation":"Assistance Publique -

These symptoms typically appear between 6 and 18 months of age (stage 2). Subsequently, there is gradual stabilisation of severe mental retardation and motor compromise (stage 3). The majority (70% to 80%) of patients show mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding-protein-2 (MeCP2) gene, located on chromosome Xq28. MeCP2 encodes a transcription repressor protein that is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues.\n\nAs RTT primarily affects females, only very few males with mutations in MeCP2 have been identified. Mutations in MeCP2 have also been identified in children with X-linked mental retardation, autism and a clinical phenotype that resembles Angelman Syndrome.\n\nThe aim of this study is to investigate the effects of a dietary supplement on the biochemical and clinical parameter of RTT. About 80 % of labile methyl groups generated through the re-methylation cycle are used for the synthesis of creatine within the human organism. Supplementation of creatine will therefore increase the availability of labile methyl groups for different methylation reactions including methylation of DNA.\n\nThe study will be double blind and cross-over. The patients will get creatine monophosphate (200 mg/kg/d in three dosages per day) or placebo. After 6 months and a wash-out period of 4 weeks the groups are changed for the next 6 months.\n\nAll participants with RTT and mutations in MeCP2 will undergo physical and neurological exam, quantitative EEG, behavioral assessment, laboratory testing, and neuropsychological evaluations. Participants will have a follow-up after 3, 6, 10, 13 and 16 months (3 months after finishing the study), which will include similar assessments."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Rett Syndrome"],"keywords":["Rett Syndrome, Randomized, Methylation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":21,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Creatine monohydrate","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The patients received orally 200 mg CMH per kg body weight divided in three doses per day.

The primary objective is to evaluate the performance of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP)-based Non Invasive Prenatal Testing (NIPT) for 22q11.2 microdeletion (DiGeorge syndrome) in this large cohort of pregnant women. This will be done by performing a review of perinatal medical records and obtaining biospecimens after birth to perform genetic diagnostic testing for 22q11.2 deletion. Results from the follow-up specimens will be compared to those obtained by the Panorama screening test to determine test performance. Specific test performance parameters will include: PPV, specificity, and sensitivity.","detailedDescription":"The primary objective is to determine in a prospective study the performance of SNP based NIPT for the 22q11.2 microdeletion (DiGeorge syndrome) in a large cohort of pregnant women clinically opting for this form of screening.

Determine the failure ('no call') rate for the Next-generation Aneuploidy Test Using SNPs (NATUS) method for 22q11.2 detection, as well as for aneuploidy.\n3. Determine whether a more precise risk for aneuploidy can be generated in the setting of low fetal fraction by incorporating maternal BMI (adjusted fetal fraction percentile).\n4. Assess whether low fetal fraction is associated with specific ultrasound findings that may indicate aneuploidy (e.g. triploidy, trisomy 13 and 18).\n5. Investigate the relationship between NIPT and sonographic (nuchal translucency and anatomy survey) markers and serum markers from 1st and 2nd trimester aneuploidy screening.\n6. Determine sensitivity, specificity, and PPV for chromosomal aneuploidies and sex chromosome abnormalities.\n7. Perform detailed assessment of false positive aneuploidy samples to better understand sources of error, including placental studies to further refine issues surrounding mosaicism as NIPT represents circulating placental DNA.\n8.

This study concerns the pharmacokinetic study.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to :\n\n* Establish the 24 hour baseline profile of endogenous saliva melatonin concentrations and urine 6-SMT excretion in children aged 2 up to and including 17 years with neurodevelopmental disorders with sleep disturbances.\n* Establish the concentration-time profile of saliva melatonin concentrations and 24 hour 6-SMT urine excretion after 2 and 10 mg Circadin® mini-tablets single dose administration in children aged 2 up to and including 17 years with neurodevelopmental disorders with sleep disturbances.\n* Evaluate the adverse event profile after a single dose of 2 or 10 mg Circadin® mini-tablets in children aged 2 up to and including 17 years with neurodevelopmental disorders with sleep disturbances."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Sleep Problems"],"keywords":["Sleep problems, autism spectrum disorder, prolonged-release melatonin, Circadin, endogenous saliva melatonin","Smith-Magenis syndrome, Angelman syndrome, Tuberous Sclerosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":16,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Circadin 10 mg","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Second arm higher dose","interventionNames":["Drug: Circadin 10 mg"]},{"label":"Circadin 2 mg","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"First arm lower dose","interventionNames":["Drug: Circadin 2 mg"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Circadin 2 mg","description":"First arm lower dose","armGroupLabels":["Circadin 2 mg"],"otherNames":["non"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Circadin 10 mg","description":"Second arm higher dose","armGroupLabels":["Circadin 10 mg"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"baseline profile of endogenous saliva melatonin concentrations and urine 6-SMT excretion","description":"To establish the 24 hour baseline profile of endogenous saliva melatonin concentrations and urine 6-SMT excretion in children aged 2 up to and including 17 years with neurodevelopmental disorders with sleep disturbances.","timeFrame":"up to 1 year"},{"measure":"concentration-time profile of saliva melatonin concentrations and 24 hour 6-SMT urine excretion after 2 and 10 mg Circadin® mini-tablets single dose administration","description":"To establish the concentration-time profile of saliva melatonin concentrations and 24 hour 6-SMT urine excretion after 2 and 10 mg Circadin® mini-tablets single dose administration in children aged 2 up to and including 17 years with neurodevelopmental disorders with sleep disturbances.","timeFrame":"up to 1 year"},{"measure":"adverse event profile after a single dose of 2 or 10 mg Circadin® mini-tablets","description":"To evaluate the adverse event profile after a single dose of 2 or 10 mg Circadin® mini-tablets in children aged 2 up to and including 17 years with neurodevelopmental disorders with sleep disturbances.","timeFrame":"up to 1 year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subject must be 2 to 17 years old\n\nSubject has a documented history of autistic spectrum disorder (ASD; as confirmed according to, DSM-IV-TR 299.00, 299.10 and 299.80 or ICD 10: F 84.0, F84.2, F84.3, F84.5, F84.9 ) or one of the following neurogenetic diseases according to ICD 10: Smith-Magenis syndrome, Angelman syndrome or Tuberous Sclerosis (Bourneville's disease)\n\nSubject has current sleep problems; defined as difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, or non restorative sleep, for at least 1 month (DSM-IV 307.42).

The study has three main objectives: 1) develop and implement an approach to identify affected infants, 2) address the impact on infants and families who screen positive, and 3) evaluate the Early Check program. The Early Check screening will lead to earlier identification of newborns with rare health conditions in addition to providing important data on the implementation of this model program. Early diagnosis may result in health and development benefits for the newborns. Infants who have newborn screening in North Carolina will be eligible to participate, equating to over 120,000 eligible infants a year. Over 95% of participants are expected to screen negative. Newborns who screen positive and their parents are invited to additional research activities and services. Parents can enroll eligible newborns on the Early Check electronic Research Portal. Screening tests are conducted on residual blood from existing newborn screening dried blood spots. Confirmatory testing is provided free-of-charge for infants who screen positive, and carrier testing is provided to mothers of infants with fragile X. Affected newborns have a physical and developmental evaluation. Their parents have genetic counseling and are invited to participate in surveys and interviews. Ongoing evaluation of the program includes additional parent interviews.","detailedDescription":"\"Background\" Newborn screening (NBS) is a state-based public health program that screens babies for a panel of over 30 conditions. It is estimated that about 12,500 newborns each year in the United States are identified with one of the conditions screened in NBS, with each child receiving the benefit of early treatment. For inclusion in newborn screening there must be evidence that pre-symptomatic treatment is more effective than treatment after clinical presentation. Most conditions proposed for newborn screening are rare, however, and researchers have difficulty identifying sufficient numbers of babies to test the benefits of pre-symptomatic identification and treatment. This lack of data is central to challenges that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children (ACHDNC) faces when making federal recommendations to states on which conditions should be included in newborn screening programs. ACHDNC is often asked to consider conditions for inclusion in newborn screening for which there is limited evidence of the natural history, prevalence, and especially about the benefit of early treatment.\n\n\"Rationale\" That evidence gap, especially in the rare disease context, makes it important to develop and test a system to efficiently generate high-quality data about conditions that have the potential to be candidates for state newborn screening. The Early Check program will address this gap through screening newborns for a carefully selected panel of conditions, offered under a research protocol with biological maternal permission, except in cases where there is a transfer or loss of custody. In cases with a transfer/loss of custody, a legal guardian can grant permission for the infant to join Early Check. Early Check will identify pre-symptomatic infants with rare disorders, accelerate the acquisition of data on the early natural history of rare disorders, and demonstrate the feasibility of a statewide program to offer voluntary opt-in newborn screening for a panel of conditions not currently included in states' standard newborn screening. Further, Early Check will facilitate the public health 'on-boarding' of conditions that are ultimately recommended for state newborn screening programs.\n\nThe initial panel of conditions screened in the Early Check program will change over the course of the study. Previously screened conditions have included spinal muscular dystrophy (SMA), fragile X syndrome (FXS), and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and related neuromuscular conditions that result in increased levels of creatine kinase (CK-MM). SMA has an approved treatment, nusinersen, which has been demonstrated to improve outcomes in infants with infantile-onset SMA. In addition, infants with a shorter disease duration compared to a longer disease duration had improved outcomes after the start of treatment with nusinersen, suggesting that earlier identification of SMA would benefit affected infants. There is also an approved gene therapy, Zolgensma, for SMA. FXS does not have an approved treatment, although there is evidence that early behavioral intervention services may improve outcomes. Given that the diagnosis of FXS is made on average after the child is three years old, early identification through the screening of newborns may provide benefit to the child. These conditions are rare; SMA has an estimated incidence of 1 in \\~10,000, DMD has an estimated incidence of 1 in 4000-5000 males, and FXS has an estimated incidence of 1 in \\~4,000 males and 1 in \\~4,000-6,000 females. We also completed a sub-study with a secondary permission process that offers mothers the choice to obtain additional data about the gene that causes FXS: specifically, whether the infant has a premutation in the gene, which has an uncertain impact on the infant's learning and development. This uncertainty is the reason why premutation results are offered separately under a sub-study. DMD causes progressive inflammation, fibrosis, and muscle fiber degradation, and weakness. DMD has traditionally been treated with physical therapy, corticosteroids, and ACE inhibitors to delay the progression of skeletal muscle and cardiac damage. In 2016, the FDA approved Eteplirsen (Exondys, 51) a promising treatment for a subset of patients with DMD. In 2017 the FDA approved Emflaza, a corticosteroid also known as deflazacort. In 2019 the FDA approved Vyondys 53 and in 2020 the FDA approved Viltepso for mutations amenable to exon 53 skipping. Early diagnosis allows for treatments that might work best if used presymptomatically.\n\nThe current screening panel includes 182 genes for rare conditions that are highly actionable by age 2. An optional secondary panel includes 32 genes that are less actionable, or for which there are treatments under trial, with an additional optional third panel that screens for genetic risk for Type 1 Diabetes.\n\nFor a wide range of rare disorders there is evidence that a delayed diagnosis (i.e., the frequently-described diagnostic odyssey as parents search for a diagnosis) can have negative health outcomes on children who miss out on treatments or interventions and on families who experience negative psychosocial impact\n\nIn the future, Early Check will continue to integrate new conditions to the screening platform as science advances and funding is secured, and conditions may be removed from the screening platform as associated research questions are answered and/or conditions achieve inclusion in state newborn screening programs (as was the case with SMA and FXS).\n\nThe overall research question is whether Early Check is an effective onboarding program to inform newborn screening policy decision-making.\n\nEarly Check will also provide the infrastructure to facilitate translational research studies and clinical trials. A dilemma in research in rare diseases is a lack of sufficient numbers of presymptomatic patients. New treatments are being developed for rare diseases at a rapid pace. Presymptomatic treatment often has the best potential for effective treatment. Currently, early identification and intervention is based on the prenatal or early diagnosis of a sibling of a patient with known disease, which greatly limits the numbers of presymptomatic patients available for trials. Newborn screening has the greatest potential to identify presymptomatic infants. Ultimately the research program should more rapidly advance understanding of diseases and treatments, reducing the length of time for appropriate conditions to be added to the recommended panel for inclusion in state newborn screening programs, and provide early identification of affected newborns.\n\nOverall, this project will provide important information about the success of Early Check to feasibly and acceptably implement a large scale, electronically-mediated research approach to accurately identify affected infants. Results of the research activities and the ongoing quality assessment will be used to inform the most efficient and judicious translation of expanded newborn screening into public health in ways that maximize benefit and minimize potential risk of harm to children and families."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Spinal Muscular Atrophy","Fragile X Syndrome","Fragile X - Premutation","Duchenne
